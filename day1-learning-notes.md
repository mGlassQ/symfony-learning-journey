### Notes of the first _Qvest Digital_ day
_Qvest Digital_ works in cycles consisting of requirements definition, implementation, and review. This is called "Scrum Principle".
Every two weeks, the results are presented to stakeholders, who can provide feedback and make suggestions.  
The product owner at Qvest Digital is Klaus Buntenkoetter. He sets new goals, checks that tasks have been completed, and defines new tasks. 
Eleonora Geiser is the Scrum Master. She ensures the team's efficiency, removes obstacles, and helps optimize internal processes. 
The team itself consists of the developers at \qvdi (Anthony Ivanov, Tsvetomira Galcheva, and Evgeni Aleksiev). They implement the tasks necessary to complete the sprint.   
Once a week, the Product Owner meets with some team members, and the new tasks are assessed in terms of their time requirements and importance. 
To this end, 1 to 5 points are awarded per category. These processes are documented in _Confluence_.  

The sprints are planned in Azure DevOps in boards. 
These boards consist of columns representing different statuses into which the tasks can be classified according to their progress. 
The backlog can also be viewed there, as well as what the individual employees are currently doing or have done.  

A retrospective takes place twice a month. This is handled via _Miro_. 
Brainstorming and process mapping (visualization of the workflow) also take place in _Miro_. 
The team wall, where individual team members introduce themselves, can also be found there.  

_GitHub, PHPStorm_, and _ArgoCD_ are used for programming, with _Symfony7_ as the framework. An important customer of _Qvest Digital_ is _Plusnet_. A feedback to the Onboarding day was send to the Scrum Master.
